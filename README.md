How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
	To effectively interpret user needs and implement them into a program, it is crucial to engage with users through interviews, surveys, and observation to gather insights about their requirements and pain points. This information should then be translated into actionable features within the software. Creating “user stories” is a valuable technique in this process; these concise descriptions of user interactions with the system help clarify what users want to achieve and why. User stories typically follow a simple format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit]." This structure not only prioritizes user needs but also facilitates communication among team members, ensuring that everyone understands the goals of the project.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
	To effectively develop programs, it is essential to begin with a clear understanding of the project requirements and objectives. This involves gathering input from stakeholders, defining user stories, and establishing acceptance criteria. Once the foundation is set, adopting Agile methodologies can significantly enhance the development process. I hope to incorporate scrum into my future development work since throughout this term I have learned a ton about the agile process as a whole, 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
	Being a good team member in software development means demonstrating effective communication, reliability, and collaboration. Good team members actively share ideas, provide constructive feedback, and are open to receiving input from others. They understand their roles and responsibilities within the team, contribute consistently to meet shared goals, and foster a supportive environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to succeed. Additionally, they should be adaptable to changes and willing to help others when challenges arise.
